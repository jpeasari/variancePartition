### Application of variancePartition R package on immVar dataset

immVar: The Immune Variation (immVar) project gives the information about the variation extent in the healthy human immune function subjects. The authors (De Jager, et al, 2015) of this project aimed at mapping genetic architecture of both adaptive and innate immunologic transcriptomes across human population. They dealt with analyzing genetic variation in the immune transcriptome. The project also aimed at quantifying the variance that eventually help future studies of immune function in health and disease.

variancePartition: The variancePartition package provides the information about the driving factors of variation in the gene expression patterns. A typical design where this package was useful was a gene expression from individuals from various tissues or cell types. The ultimate goal is to understand the variation between the
